# economic-freedom-regression

# What is this?

This is a regression analysis of the Economic Freedom Index published every year by the [Heritage Foundation](https://www.heritage.org/index/).
This project is for my Algorithms class, in partial fulfillment of my requirements for the degree of master of science in data journalism at Columbia.

# How it works

There are two files in here: one is a Jupyter notebook containing the **linear regression model** and two, an R file containing the **fixed-effects 
model**. This is done so because of technical difficulties to run a fixed-effects model using Python and to give more users wider access to the models.

Both files use the CSV file provided for in **raw_data** directory.

# What is the data about?

The data measures the so-called "economic freedom" of select countries. More information about the index can be read [here](https://www.heritage.org/index/about). The index is a closely watched report by policymakers and other observers to gauge how open/liberalize a country is
to investors, businesses and traders.

# What is the project

For this repository, we used the subindex **"Business Freedom"** as the dependent variable and ran other subindices such as **Judicial Effectiveness** and
**Property Rights** as independent variables in a regression. The goal is to assess which among these variables best determine business freedom across
territories.
